        <ul>
          <li>CSS atributes are properties that influence the styling and layout of HTML elements. Each property controls a small part of the overall style.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>Declarations in CSS contain 2 important components: the CSS property we want to apply and
              the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. 
              with class selectors, we can assign CSS rule to a specific elements, who share the same names.</li>
